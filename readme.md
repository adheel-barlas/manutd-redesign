Manchester United FC Redesign
=============

This is a MUFC redesign. This project was taken as a personal project to see how I could improve the official Manchester United website by mainly bringing a modern user interface to the website. 

Interestingly, this project was done before the actual redesign was made live. The latest website does follow a similar design in terms of a card layout. 

Note: this is only a landing page redesign, although I would like to come back and complete the whole site, perhaps taking ideas from the official Manchester United redesign.
